# ⚡ ResPy – Energy Trading Tool

**ResPy** is a Python-based toolkit designed to centralize and process power market data for advanced analysis, forecasting, and decision support in energy trading.

Its core purpose is to model and simulate a wide range of renewable assets—starting with **solar** and **wind farms**, and later extending to **battery storage systems**. ResPy also supports **backtesting of hedging strategies** and **automated analytics workflows** tailored for short-term electricity markets.
